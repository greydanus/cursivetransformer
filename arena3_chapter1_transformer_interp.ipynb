        "\n",
        "This section is designed to get you up to speed with the TransformerLens library. You'll learn how to load and run models, and learn about the shared architecture template for all of these models (the latter of which should be familiar to you if you've already done the exercises that come before these, since many of the same design principles are followed).\n",
        "\n",
        "> ##### Learning objectives\n",
        ">\n",
        "> - Load and run a `HookedTransformer` model\n",
        "> - Understand the basic architecture of these models\n",
        "> - Use the model's tokenizer to convert text to tokens, and vice versa\n",
        "> - Know how to cache activations, and to access activations from the cache\n",
        "> - Use `circuitsvis` to visualise attention heads\n",

        "#### 2️⃣ Finding induction heads\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "#### 3️⃣ TransformerLens: Hooks\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, you'll learn about hooks, which are a great feature of TransformerLens allowing you to access and intervene on activations within the model. We will mainly focus on the basics of hooks and using them to access activations (we'll mainly save the causal interventions for the later IOI exercises). You will also build some tools to perform logit attribution within your model, so you can identify which components are responsible for your model's performance on certain tasks.\n",

        ">\n",
        "> - Understand what hooks are, and how they are used in TransformerLens\n",
        "> - Use hooks to access activations, process the results, and write them to an external tensor\n",
        "> - Build tools to perform attribution, i.e. detecting which components of your model are responsible for performance on a given task\n",
        "> - Understand how hooks can be used to perform basic interventions like **ablation**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4️⃣ Reverse-engineering induction circuits\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, these exercises show you how you can reverse-engineer a circuit by looking directly at a transformer's weights (which can be considered a \"gold standard\" of interpretability; something not possible in every situation). You'll examine QK and OV circuits by multiplying through matrices (and learn how the FactoredMatrix class makes matrices like these much easier to analyse). You'll also look for evidence of composition between two induction heads, and once you've found it then you'll investigate the functionality of the full circuit formed from this composition.\n",

        "> - Use the factored matrix class to inspect the QK and OV circuits within an induction circuit\n",

        "This is a demo notebook for [TransformerLens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens), **a library I ([Neel Nanda](neelnanda.io)) wrote for doing [mechanistic interpretability](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/) of GPT-2 Style language models.** The goal of mechanistic interpretability is to take a trained model and reverse engineer the algorithms the model learned during training from its weights. It is a fact about the world today that we have computer programs that can essentially speak English at a human level (GPT-3, PaLM, etc), yet we have no idea how they work nor how to write one ourselves. This offends me greatly, and I would like to solve this! Mechanistic interpretability is a very young and small field, and there are a *lot* of open problems - if you would like to help, please try working on one! **Check out my [list of concrete open problems](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WONBzNqfKIxERejrrPlQMyKqg7jSFW92x5UMXNrMdPo/edit#) to figure out where to start.**\n",
        "\n",
        "I wrote this library because after I left the Anthropic interpretability team and started doing independent research, I got extremely frustrated by the state of open source tooling. There's a lot of excellent infrastructure like HuggingFace and DeepSpeed to *use* or *train* models, but very little to dig into their internals and reverse engineer how they work. **This library tries to solve that**, and to make it easy to get into the field even if you don't work at an industry org with real infrastructure! The core features were heavily inspired by [Anthropic's excellent Garcon tool](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/garcon/index.html). Credit to Nelson Elhage and Chris Olah for building Garcon and showing me the value of good infrastructure for accelerating exploratory research!\n",
        "\n",
        "The core design principle I've followed is to enable exploratory analysis - one of the most fun parts of mechanistic interpretability compared to normal ML is the extremely short feedback loops! The point of this library is to keep the gap between having an experiment idea and seeing the results as small as possible, to make it easy for **research to feel like play** and to enter a flow state. This notebook demonstrates how the library works and how to use it, but if you want to see how well it works for exploratory research, check out [my notebook analysing Indirect Objection Identification](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens/blob/main/Exploratory_Analysis_Demo.ipynb) or [my recording of myself doing research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo4QvDn-vsU)!\n"

Notably, **this includes** `model.forward` (which is what's implicitly used when you do eg `model(\"Hello World\")`). You can disable this behaviour by setting the flag `prepend_bos=False` in `to_tokens`, `to_str_tokens`, `model.forward` and any other function that converts strings to multi-token tensors.\n",
        "\n",
        "`prepend_bos` is a bit of a hack, and I've gone back and forth on what the correct default here is. The reason I do this is that transformers tend to treat the first token weirdly - this doesn't really matter in training (where all inputs are >1000 tokens), but this can be a big issue when investigating short prompts! The reason for this is that attention patterns are a probability distribution and so need to add up to one, so to simulate being \"off\" they normally look at the first token. Giving them a BOS token lets the heads rest by looking at that, preserving the information in the first \"real\" token.\n",

        "* They are responsible for a significant loss decrease - so much so that there's a visible bump in the loss curve when they develop (this change in loss can be pretty comparable to the increase in loss from major increases in model size, though this is hard to make an apples-to-apples comparison)\n",

        "[PyTorch hooks](https://blog.paperspace.com/pytorch-hooks-gradient-clipping-debugging/) are a great and underrated, yet incredibly janky, feature. They can act on a layer, and edit the input or output of that layer, or the gradient when applying autodiff. The key difference is that **Hook points** act on *activations* not layers. This means that you can intervene within a layer on each activation, and don't need to care about the precise layer structure of the transformer. And it's immediately clear exactly how the hook's effect is applied. This adjustment was shamelessly inspired by [Garcon's use of ProbePoints](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/garcon/index.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "They also come with a range of other quality of life improvements. PyTorch's hooks are global state, which can be a massive pain if you accidentally leave a hook on a model. TransformerLens hooks are also global state, but `run_with_hooks` tries to create an abstraction where these are local state by removing all hooks at the end of the function (and they come with a helpful `model.reset_hooks()` method to remove all hooks).\n",

        "* We performed **logit attribution** on the model, and found that the values written to the residual stream by heads `1.4` and `1.10` were both important for getting us correct predictions in the second half of the sequence.\n",

But if two heads are deliberately composing, then they will likely want to ensure they write and read from similar subspaces, so that minimal information is lost.

(If our repeating sequence is `A B ... A B`, then it's the QK circuit's job to make sure the second `A` attends to the first `B`, and it's the OV circuit's job to project the residual vector at that position onto the **embedding space** in order to extract the `B`-information, while hopefully ignoring anything else that has been written to that position by the heads in layer 0).

        "So we can work with the `FactoredMatrix` class. This also provides the method `.norm()` which returns the Frobenium norm. This is also a good opportunity to bring back baching - this will sometimes be useful in our analysis. In the function below, `W_As` and `W_Bs` are both >2D factored matrices (e.g. they might represent the OV circuits for all heads in a particular layer, or across multiple layers), and the function's output should be a tensor of composition scores for each pair of matrices `(W_A, W_B)` in the >2D tensors `(W_As, W_Bs)`.\n"

The post is structured around six different points of evidence for the hypothesis that **induction heads are the main source of in-context learning in transformer models**, even large ones. Briefly, these are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Transformers undergo a \"phase change\" where they suddenly become much better at in-context learning, and this is around the same time induction heads appear.\n",
        "2. When we change the transformer's architecture to make it easier for induction heads to form, we get a corresponding improvement in in-context learning.\n",
        "3. When we ablate induction heads at runtime, in-context learning gets worse.\n",
        "4. We have specific examples of induction heads performing more complex in-context learning algorithms (you'll have the opportunity to investigate one of these later - **indirect object identification**).\n",
        "5. We have a mechanistic explanation of induction heads, which suggests natural extensions to more general forms of in-context learning.\n",
        "6. In-context learning-related behaviour is generally smoothly continuous between small and large models, suggesting that the underlying mechanism is also the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are a few questions for you:\n",
        "\n",
        "* How compelling do you find this evidence? Discuss with your partner.\n",
        "    * Which points do you find most compelling?\n",
        "    * Which do you find least compelling?\n",
        "    * Are there any subset of these which would be enough to convince you of the hypothesis, in the absence of others?\n",
        "* In point 3, the paper observes that in-context learning performance degrades when you ablate induction heads. While we measured this by testing the model's ability to copy a duplicated random sequence, the paper used **in-context learning score** (the loss of the 500th token in the context, minus the loss on the 50th token).\n",
        "    * Can you see why this is a reasonable metric?\n",
        "    * Can you replicate these results (maybe on a larger model than the 2-layer one we've been using)?\n",
        "* In point 4 (more complex forms of in-context learning), the paper suggests the natural extension of \"fuzzy induction heads\", which match patterns like `[A*][B*]...[A][B]` rather than `[A][B]...[A][B]` (where the `*` indicates some form of linguistic similarity, not necessarily being the same token).\n",
